      "The Welsh are a very shy people. They're really quite sheepish...!"

      Hahaaa anyway, I just spent probably around 20 minutes googling Welsh jokes and they all have to do with very inappropriate associations between the Welsh's love of sheep over women... Very interesting.

      So far, I've seen some pretty interesting things. I hiked out to this rock named "Arthur's rock", which is allegedly a neolithic burial chamber. However, it was deemed "Arthur's Rock", as the story goes that Arthur threw a rock from his shoe and it rolled so far it turned into a boulder!

      Also, I've seen Cardiff Castle, which was really cool. We went into the underground bunker tunnels that they used as drill areas during WWII, and they were playing really loud airplane noises while we walked through the tunnels. Then, it changed to very, very creepy 1920's music that was all scratchy and sounded like it was out of a horror movie :O. We sprinted out of there.
