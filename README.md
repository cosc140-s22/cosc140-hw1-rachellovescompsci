# COSC140 homework 1

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?
  Probably somewhere close to 3 hours 

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
 I thought it would be pretty hard at first, but once I got to it and utilized you and James's help it got much more doable. I like how complicated it can get, and how you can isolate specific sections or elements with id or class. I think I could somehow improve the formatting if you make the window smaller, but that seems pretty complicated to make it all move together.

Well done.  Really nice photos and good work on the structure and styling.
